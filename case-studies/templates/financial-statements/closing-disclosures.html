        <div class="note-header">NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES</div>
        
        <div class="sub-header">Nature of Operations</div>
        <p>Johnson & Sons Heating, Plumbing, & Air ("the Company") is an S-Corporation engaged in commercial, industrial, and institutional mechanical contracting services. Founded in 1979, the Company operates as a specialty trade contractor providing HVAC and plumbing installation, service, and maintenance for large-scale construction projects throughout the southwestern United States.</p>
        
        <p>The Company maintains operations in three states with the following revenue distribution:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Arizona (Phoenix headquarters): 50% of revenue</li>
            <li>Utah (Salt Lake City): 30% of revenue</li>
            <li>Colorado (Denver): 20% of revenue</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Company holds the following primary contractor licenses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Arizona: C-36 Plumbing and C-20 HVAC Contractor Licenses</li>
            <li>Utah: S-210 HVAC and S-220 Plumbing Contractor Licenses</li>
            <li>Colorado: Master Plumber and Mechanical Contractor Licenses</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="sub-header">Basis of Presentation and Consolidation</div>
        <p>The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP). All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated entities include the operating company and its wholly-owned equipment leasing subsidiary.</p>

        <div class="sub-header">Revenue Recognition (ASC 606)</div>
        <div class="policy-box">
            <p><strong>Construction Contracts - Percentage of Completion Method:</strong></p>
            <p>The Company recognizes revenue on long-term construction contracts over time using the cost-to-cost method as the measure of progress toward satisfaction of performance obligations. This method is used because management considers it to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts.</p>
            
            <p>Under this method:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contract costs include all direct material, labor, subcontract costs, and those indirect costs related to contract performance</li>
                <li>General and administrative costs are expensed as incurred</li>
                <li>Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined</li>
                <li>Changes in job performance, conditions, and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and income, recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Variable Consideration:</strong></p>
            <p>The transaction price includes variable consideration such as claims, incentive fees, and change orders to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. The Company uses the expected value method to estimate variable consideration based on historical experience and project-specific factors.</p>

            <p><strong>Contract Modifications:</strong></p>
            <p>Contract modifications are routine in the construction industry. The Company considers modifications to exist when the modification either creates new or changes existing enforceable rights and obligations. Most modifications are for goods or services that are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration service provided and are accounted for as if they were part of that existing contract.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-header">Contract Balances</div>
        <p><strong>Contract Assets:</strong> Represent the Company's right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights become unconditional.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Contract Liabilities:</strong> Represent the Company's obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which consideration has been received. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue as (or when) the Company performs under the contract.</p>

        <div class="sub-header">Accounts Receivable and Credit Risk</div>
        <p>Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company extends credit to customers in the normal course of business and performs ongoing credit evaluations. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Historical collection experience</li>
            <li>Current economic conditions</li>
            <li>Review of the current status of trade accounts receivable</li>
            <li>Industry-specific factors including mechanics' lien rights</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="sub-header">Construction Costs and Estimated Earnings in Excess of Billings</div>
        <p>Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings represent revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed on uncompleted contracts and are included in contract assets. The Company regularly reviews these amounts to ensure collectability.</p>

        <div class="sub-header">Inventory Valuation</div>
        <p>Inventory consists primarily of HVAC equipment, plumbing materials, sheet metal, and construction supplies. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The Company maintains inventory at each of its three locations to support rapid project deployment.</p>

        <div class="sub-header">Intangible Assets and Goodwill</div>
        <p>Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.</p>

        <div class="sub-header">Self-Insurance Programs</div>
        <p>The Company is self-insured for certain losses relating to workers' compensation, general liability, and auto liability up to specified retention levels. Estimated losses are accrued based upon the Company's historical loss experience, third-party actuarial analysis, and industry factors.</p>

        <div class="sub-header">Warranty Costs</div>
        <p>The Company provides warranties on installation work ranging from one to two years. Estimated warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized based on historical claim rates adjusted for current trends and specific project risks.</p>

        <div class="sub-header">Income Taxes</div>
        <p>As an S-Corporation, the Company's taxable income is passed through to its shareholders and taxed at the individual level. The Company makes quarterly tax distributions to shareholders based on the highest combined federal and state marginal tax rates applicable to its income.</p>

        <div class="sub-header">Use of Estimates</div>
        <p>The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The reported amounts of assets and liabilities</li>
            <li>Disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities</li>
            <li>The reported amounts of revenues and expenses</li>
            <li>Percentage-of-completion calculations</li>

        <div class="sub-header">Construction Industry Risks</div>
        <p><strong>Economic Sensitivity:</strong> The construction industry is highly sensitive to economic cycles, interest rates, and credit availability. A downturn could significantly impact project starts and the Company's backlog.</p>

        <p><strong>Weather and Seasonality:</strong> Construction activity typically slows in Q1 due to weather conditions, particularly in Colorado and Utah. The Company experiences 15-20% lower productivity during winter months.</p>

        <p><strong>Material Price Volatility:</strong> The Company faces exposure to commodity price fluctuations, particularly for copper, steel, and specialized HVAC equipment. Fixed-price contracts create risk when material costs escalate rapidly.</p>

        <div class="sub-header">Competitive Environment</div>
        <p>The mechanical contracting industry has experienced:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Increased competition from non-union contractors offering 15-20% lower pricing</li>
            <li>Consolidation among larger contractors creating pricing pressure</li>
            <li>Technology disruption requiring investment in BIM and prefabrication</li>
            <li>Gross margin compression from 22.5% (2022) to 20.0% (2024)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="sub-header">Labor Market Challenges</div>
        <p>The Company faces significant workforce challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Skilled labor shortage with 10-15% annual wage inflation</li>
            <li>Aging workforce - 35% of field staff eligible for retirement within 5 years</li>
            <li>Competition for talent from non-construction industries</li>
            <li>4-year apprenticeship programs limiting rapid expansion</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="sub-header">Technology Investment Requirements</div>
        <p>To remain competitive, the Company has identified critical technology needs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Building Information Modeling (BIM): $350,000</li>
            <li>Prefabrication equipment and software: $250,000</li>
            <li>Cloud-based project management upgrade: $150,000</li>
            <li>Total identified investment: $750,000</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="sub-header">Key Personnel Dependency</div>
        <p>The Company's success depends heavily on retaining:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>General Manager (age 62) - considering retirement in 3-5 years</li>
            <li>Two senior Project Managers managing 40% of backlog</li>
            <li>Three Regional Project Executives with 15+ years tenure</li>
            <li>Specialized estimating team with proprietary knowledge</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="sub-header">Regulatory and Compliance</div>
        <p>The Company operates in a highly regulated environment:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Multi-state licensing requirements</li>
            <li>Prevailing wage compliance on public projects</li>
            <li>Environmental regulations for refrigerants</li>
            <li>OSHA safety requirements</li>

        <div class="sub-header">Percentage-of-Completion Estimates</div>
        <p>The most critical accounting estimates relate to total costs at completion for construction contracts. Key assumptions include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Labor productivity rates based on historical performance</li>
            <li>Material cost escalation factors</li>
            <li>Weather delay allowances</li>
            <li>Subcontractor performance risk</li>
            <li>Change order probability and pricing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A 1% change in estimated gross margin on contracts in progress would impact income by approximately $880,000.</p>

        <div class="sub-header">Allowance for Doubtful Accounts</div>
        <p>The Company estimates credit losses based on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Historical collection rates by customer type</li>
            <li>Current economic conditions in construction markets</li>
            <li>Specific identification of at-risk accounts</li>
            <li>Mechanics' lien rights and recovery probability</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="sub-header">Self-Insurance Reserves</div>
        <p>Actuarial estimates for self-insured risks consider:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Historical claim frequency and severity</li>
            <li>Industry loss development factors</li>
            <li>Specific large claim reserves</li>
            <li>IBNR calculations based on exposure</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="sub-header">Warranty Reserves</div>
        <p>Warranty cost estimates are based on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Historical warranty claim rates (0.6% of revenue)</li>
            <li>Known installation issues requiring remediation</li>
            <li>Equipment manufacturer warranty coverage</li>
